#Self Evaluation for Arrays

1. How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?

*I feel confident in my understanding of arrays, but I know I will make mistakes with regard to index position, until I learn to adjust to starting from 0 automatically.*

1. Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?

*I'm curious to look through a list of some of the most used array methods to see what actions are commonly needed*

1. What questions do you have about Arrays?

*I am* **very** *much a novice to coding, but I have done a tiny bit of learning in C. I know that, in C, strings are not exactly their own datatype, but arrays of characters. I'm curious if the same is true in JS and all languages, or if that is something that evolved over the course of language development and is different in other coding languages.*
